## About TabTools

"TabTools" is my pet name for this Laravel-backed application meant to house any and all
web applications I decide(d) to code up in my spare time. It runs on Laravel 5.7 and utilizes Bootstrap 4
for its design.

## Current Projects Included
	# Vue Notepad
	A small notepad application I wrote as a way to flex my Vue.js muscles. Includes functionality to
	create/update/delete notes in a (mostly) responsive UI.
